# bilingual_wedding_mass_booklet

This booklet represents an extension of the matrita package, a LaTeX package for catholic wedding Mass booklet (https://github.com/franen/matrita), to bilingual wedding Mass booklets.

The example here attached is written in two languages, on facing pages: all the left pages are in Italian, while all the right pages of the booklet are in Finnish.

The parallel-text typesetting was performed by using :

(1) reledpar package (https://ctan.org/pkg/reledpar?lang=en) and

(2) reledmac package (https://ctan.org/pkg/reledmac?lang=en)

Note: the booklet here attached is the final version used for a catholic (mixed) wedding Mass, celebrated in Italy, and the content of the booklet (the italian part) was reviewed by a minster of the italian Roman Catholic Church.
