# bilingual_wedding_mass_booklet: general information

This booklet represents an extension of the matrita package, a LaTeX package for catholic wedding Mass booklet (https://github.com/franen/matrita), to bilingual wedding Mass booklets.

The example here attached is written in two languages, on facing pages: all the left pages are in Italian, while all the right pages of the booklet are in Finnish.

The parallel-text typesetting was performed by using :

(1) reledpar package (https://ctan.org/pkg/reledpar?lang=en) and

(2) reledmac package (https://ctan.org/pkg/reledmac?lang=en)

Note 1: the booklet here attached is the final version used for a catholic wedding Mass, celebrated in Italy, and the content of the booklet (the italian part) was reviewed by a minister of the italian Roman Catholic Church.

Note 2: Since the three main packages used here, i.e. matrita, reledpar and reledmac were not designed to work together, a number of workarounds has been applied here to create a harmonious and working manuscript (in particular, to set up the vertical spaces all around the text - that part was challenging).
